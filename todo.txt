TEST
- test different move gens
- test mating positions, winning positions
- add asserts everywhere

MOVE GEN
# dont score moves in movegen
- run move gen after hash move failed -> pvs still possible?
# check evasion
- quiesence move gen (checks, captures, promotions, ?), no see score for special captures PxQ
- Jazz:leaves_king_in_check for move generation instead of inCheck() -> only check pinned pieces / king attacks

PROJECT
- clean up utils, attacks, helper bitboards
- detect endgames (knight, bishop endgame, light/dark squared bishop)
- iid if no hash move
- try hash move before generating moves?
- use inline functions for bit move macros
- update typedefs, src, structs, key_t, ...

REWRITE SEARCH
- Adaptive null move pruning -> drop into qui
- Mate distance pruning
- delta pruning
- futility pruning / reverse null move pruning
- razoring
- tt probing
- Aspiration windows
- pvs
- late move reductions
- see reductions

# killer moves
# matekiller moves
# counter moves
# history heuristic

HASH TABLE
- prefetch table instruction
- buckets
- rework table probing (in search)
- hash table with negative depth in qsearch

EVALUATION
- lazy eval for qsearch or pruning areas
- more heuristics
- traps, pins
- (texel) tuning

POSSIBLE
- Lazy SMP
- Endgame tablebase
