# Todo

- Move Generation

  - ~~`scoreMoves()` instead of scoring while generating~~
  - ~~run move gen after hash move failed -> pvs still possible?~~
  - ~~check evasion~~
  - ~~quiesence move gen (captures, promotions, check evasions)~~
  - ~~generate quiet checks~~
  - ~~special see function with early exit for captures like PxQ~~
  - ~~Early return inCheck function is fastest and most reliable, do not use isLegal or leaesKingInCheck~~
  - ~~faster isCheck method? instead of inCheck() -> only check pinned pieces / king attacks of last move~~

- Project

  - ~~detect endgames (knight, bishop endgame, light/dark squared bishop)~~
